# ReadMe Template

Made this program to make readme templates so that I don't have to manually create or copy paste each time I start a new leetcode.

This template is the one I created for leetcode but can be modified to whatever and makes easy to change/update reusable markdown template.

This could easily be modified to create based on a set of templates, but for now just one.

## How do you do?

Just clone this or copypaste to your personal.

If you clone you can just make an alias in your bash like `alias readme=$(PWD)/main`  or something.

If you copy/paste then just build it and create an alias like above. up to you brah.

have fun with it :)
